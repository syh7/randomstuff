# What is this?

Repository for random coding ideas. Current ideas:

1. Monopoly simulation
  - pc plays the game
  - shows results, dice throws, money and any other transactions
  
2. Badminton simulation
  - Have different characters with different elo.
  - Character positions matter for where the opponent aims.
  - Elo matters in how succesful the swing is, do they hit the shuttle, is the clear high enough etc
  
3. Supermarket simulation
  - System for employees to order/search/change stock
  - Registers
  - Customers buy stuff, maybe incorporate times of day (dinner, weekends big bulk)?
